# Bionic-FG Frame Generation — Integration Report

**Branch:** `feature/bionic-fg-framegen`
**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Goal:** Integrate [bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) (an Android/bionic Vulkan
frame-generation layer) into Bannerlator as **(a)** a per-container option and **(b)** a live in-game
side-menu control.

## 1. Permission & author terms

Permission granted by the author (**xXJSONDeruloXx**). His only asks:

1. **Credit in the README.**
2. **If the source goes in the tree, add it as a git submodule** (his stated preference).
3. **Feedback and PRs are welcome.**

All three are easy to honor and are baked into the plan below.

---

## 2. What bionic-fg is

A standalone **Vulkan frame-generation layer for Android / bionic libc, arm64-v8a, API 26+** — the
**LSFG (Lossless Scaling Frame Generation)** lineage, the same engine GameHub 6.0.8 ships as
`libGameScopeVK.so` for its "AI超级插帧" feature.

- Ships as `libbionic_fg.so` + an **implicit Vulkan layer** (`VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json` →
  `VK_LAYER_BIONIC_framegen`).
- Intercepts Vulkan swapchain presentation and injects interpolated frames via embedded SPIR-V
  compute shaders (2 models).
- Uses **AHardwareBuffer sharing** between the producer and the framegen device.
- Config via **TOML** (`$HOME/.config/bionic-fg/conf.toml`): `multiplier` (2–4×, 0 = off),
  `flow_scale` (0.2–1.0), `model` (0/1). Legacy `BIONIC_FG_*` env vars also supported.
- Enabled via `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1` (+ `VK_LAYER_PATH`, optional `BIONIC_FG_CONFIG`).
- **TOML hot-reloads at runtime** (multiplier / model changes rebuild the framegen context).
- C++ only, CMake/NDK build (`build-android-arm64.sh`). **No license file yet** (permission given
  directly; ask author to add an explicit license before shipping a release).
- Repo: 10 commits, no tagged releases, last pushed 2026-05-15.

## 3. Architecture findings (recon)

### How rendering works in Bannerlator
The guest (Wine + box64 + DXVK, **glibc**) does **not** present to a normal Android swapchain. Its
Vulkan goes through a **wrapper ICD**:

- `VK_ICD_FILENAMES = imagefs/…/vulkan/icd.d/wrapper_icd.aarch64.json`
- `GALLIUM_DRIVER = zink`
- `WRAPPER_*` env vars (`XServerDisplayActivity.java:1823–1861`)

The wrapper bridges the guest's Vulkan to the **Android-side bionic GPU driver** loaded via
**adrenotools** (`AdrenotoolsManager.setDriverById` → `ADRENOTOOLS_HOOKS_PATH`,
`AdrenotoolsManager.java:205`). **That bionic driver context is exactly what bionic-fg targets.**

### Existing frame-gen groundwork already in the tree
- `app/src/main/cpp/lsfg-vk/` — a stubbed `CMakeLists.txt` (LSFG lineage), **not** built by the main
  CMake (`add_subdirectory(lsfg-vk)` is commented out; intended to build separately).
- `build-lsfg-android.sh` (repo root) — standalone NDK arm64 build script for the lsfg-vk layer.

So bionic-fg is the **bionic-targeted layer** that fits the path marcescence was already gesturing
toward. Good cross-pollination note for the author.

### Integration touch-points
| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| Container settings model (`envVars`, `graphicsDriverConfig`) | `container/Container.java` |
| Guest launch env assembly (Vulkan/wrapper block) | `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1823–1861`; `envVars` → `GuestProgramLauncherComponent.setEnvVars` (`:1285`) |
| Container settings UI (graphics section) | `ui/screens/ContainerDetailScreen.kt` |
| In-game side-menu state (StateFlow + Runnable pattern) | `ui/XServerDrawerState.kt` (template: `_nativeRenderingEnabled` / `onNativeRenderingToggle`) |
| In-game side-menu UI | `ui/XServerDrawer.kt`; callbacks wired in `XServerDisplayActivity.java` (~`:360`) |
| Native build | `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` (+ existing `build-lsfg-android.sh` precedent) |
| CI checkout (already `submodules: recursive`) | `main.yml`, `release.yml`, `build-artifacts.yml` |

## 4. ⚠️ Critical unknown (de-risk BEFORE building UI)

**Where does the layer actually load, and is there a swapchain to hook?**

- GameHub places its frame-gen engine in the **imagefs** (guest-reachable), implying the layer loads
  in the **guest wrapper context**, not the app-side Android Vulkan loader.
- A swapchain-intercepting layer needs a real `VkSwapchainKHR`. Winlator's wrapper may present via
  **AHB export with no WSI swapchain** — in which case the layer has nothing to intercept.

This is the single biggest risk. **Resolve it with a verification spike before any UI work**
(Phase 2 below). Reference GameHub's `libGameScopeVK` wiring (decompiles noted in project memory) to
copy its proven placement rather than rediscover it.

---

## 5. Recommended integration method

- **Build/bundle:** add bionic-fg to the native build for `arm64-v8a` (or reuse the standalone
  `build-lsfg-android.sh` pattern via a dedicated workflow). Ship `libbionic_fg.so` +
  `VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json` where the loader that the wrapper forwards to can find them
  (app native-lib dir **or** imagefs — TBD by the spike).
- **Container enable:** new "Frame Generation" container option. When on, inject `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1`
  + `VK_LAYER_PATH` and write the TOML config at launch. Store the preset in `graphicsDriverConfig`
  (already a free-form config field).
- **In-game live control:** the side-menu toggle/presets **rewrite the TOML at runtime** (bionic-fg
  hot-reloads). multiplier 0 = off, 2–4× = on, model 0/1, flow_scale slider — live, no relaunch.
  Mirror GameHub's preset UX.

## 6. Job task list

### Phase 0 — Honor author terms (do first, low risk) — ✅ DONE
- [x] **0.1** Add `bionic-fg` as a **git submodule** under `app/src/main/cpp/bionic-fg` → his repo.
      (Pinned at `4f71770`; `.gitmodules` created.)
- [x] **0.2** Verify CI still checks out clean (workflows already use `submodules: recursive`).
- [x] **0.3** **Credit** xXJSONDeruloXx / bionic-fg in the README Credits table + upstream-stack table.
- ⚠️ Submodule still has **no LICENSE** — carry to Phase 5.2 (ask author before any release).

### Phase 1 — Native build
- [ ] **1.1** Wire bionic-fg into the NDK build for `arm64-v8a` (subdir or standalone workflow like
      `build-lsfg-android.sh`); produce `libbionic_fg.so` + layer manifest as build artifacts.
- [ ] **1.2** Decide ship location (app native-lib dir vs imagefs) — finalized by Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — Verification spike (DE-RISK — gate the rest on this)
- [ ] **2.1** Drop the `.so` + manifest into the candidate path (start with imagefs, mirroring
      GameHub).
- [ ] **2.2** Hand-set `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1` + `VK_LAYER_PATH` in one container's `envVars`; write a
      test `conf.toml`.
- [ ] **2.3** Launch a real DXVK game; capture logcat to a crash-surviving file
      (`/sdcard/Download/*.txt`, per the device-launch rule).
- [ ] **2.4** Confirm: layer initializes? sees a swapchain / queue present? frames actually
      interpolate (FPS HUD shows the multiplier)?
- [ ] **2.5** If it only engages guest-side / needs a swapchain shim, document the real shape before
      proceeding.

### Phase 3 — Container setting (only if Phase 2 passes)
- [ ] **3.1** Add Frame-Gen config to `Container.java` (enable flag + multiplier/model/flow_scale,
      stored in `graphicsDriverConfig`).
- [ ] **3.2** Inject env + write TOML at launch in `XServerDisplayActivity` Vulkan block.
- [ ] **3.3** Add the UI control to `ContainerDetailScreen.kt` graphics section.

### Phase 4 — In-game side-menu
- [ ] **4.1** Add `_frameGenEnabled` StateFlow + `onFrameGenToggle` (+ preset callbacks) to
      `XServerDrawerState.kt`, mirroring the Native Rendering toggle.
- [ ] **4.2** Render the toggle + multiplier/model/flow_scale controls in `XServerDrawer.kt`.
- [ ] **4.3** Wire callbacks in `XServerDisplayActivity.java` to **rewrite the TOML live** (hot-reload).
- [ ] **4.4** Gray out / hide on the OpenGL renderer if frame-gen is Vulkan-only (match the existing
      effect-gating pattern).

### Phase 5 — Polish, release, give back
- [ ] **5.1** Device-confirm both surfaces on a real game.
- [ ] **5.2** Ask author to add an explicit **license** before bundling in a tagged release.
- [ ] **5.3** Send **feedback / PRs** upstream (the wrapper-ICD / AHB-present finding; any fixes).
- [ ] **5.4** Update README Full Features + cut a release with Credits.

## 7. Credits & giving back
- README credit to **xXJSONDeruloXx** (bionic-fg) is Phase 0.3, locked in before any wiring.
- Upstream feedback to send: Bannerlator's wrapper-ICD/zink + AHB-export present model and whether it
  exposes a `VkSwapchainKHR`; the existing `lsfg-vk` groundwork in marcescence; any integration
  patches as PRs.
